# 🧼 GR86 Circular CAN Display (Prototype)

This project is a prototype display system for the Toyota GR86 that uses a circular screen to show live CAN bus data. Built with ESP32 and a round LCD, it reads vehicle metrics directly from the GR86’s CAN lines and visualizes them in real-time.

> ⚠️ This is an early-stage prototype and not intended for production use. All testing should be done responsibly, and modifications to your vehicle’s CAN bus should be performed with caution.
